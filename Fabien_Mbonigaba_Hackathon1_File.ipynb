              "  'TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR PRODUCTION OF THE SECOND GENERATION OF THE COUNTRY GENDER STATUS REPORT FOR RWANDABackgroundThe Government of Rwanda has made women’s empowerment and inclusion a hallmark of recovery and reconstruction of the Country. This approach has been globally hailed as novel in both intent and scope. Gender Equality in the country is driven by the political will at the highest levels, the establishment of National Gender Machinery Institutions (Ministry of Gender and Family Promotion, Gender Monitoring Office, National Women’s Council), existing favorable policies and programs including home grown solutions as well as the revision and amendment of discriminatory laws or adoption of gender related laws such as: Law Governing Land in Rwanda which guarantees equal rights on land access, ownership and utilization; Law establishing and governing maternity leave benefits scheme where a woman is allowed 3 months fully paid maternity leave and 4 days of paternity leave to name a few.In its reconstruction journey, Rwanda has also a story to tell, a story of great achievements in several fields and specifically in positioning Gender Equality to the highest level of a constitutional fundamental principle of human rights, good governance and democracy. Several assessments demonstrate Rwanda’s achievements such as the World Economic Gender Gap Report of 2022 which ranks Rwanda as the sixth country world wide out of 146 Countries on ability to close the Gender Gap in four fundamental areas namely; Economic Participaton and opportunity, Education, Health and Surival as well as Political Empowerment. In addition, Rwandan women in leadership have played a pivotal role in the country’s political, economic and social development at all levels in the country. In Parliament, women are represented at 61.3% while 30.3% as Heads of public institutions, 40% as Governors, 42% in Judiciary and 27% as presidents of District Councils.In relation to economic empowerment, Finscope Rwanda 2020 report states that only 8% of Rwandan women are financially excluded compared to 32% in 2012 and women have embraced existing opportunities including their enrolment and participation in saving groups whereby 49% of them (women) have a formal way of saving compared to 61% of their male counterparts. ICT development in Rwanda has widened women’s education and financial opportunities among others. In Education, Rwanda has promoted the enrolment of women in STEM fields whereby in Secondary schools, in 2020/2021, 48.4% of Girls were enrolled in STEM options versus 62.5 % of their male counterparts.Within the health sector, the health workforce and infrastructure development, innovative data collection tools including Rapid SMS for emergency labor and tracking the Maternal and Child health continuum of care have resulted in considerable decrease of maternal and infant mortality rates. For example, DHS, 2019/2020 highlighted that the maternal mortality ratio has declined significantly to 203 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2019/2020 from 210 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2014-2015 down from 1071 in 2000 and the distribution of women aged 15-49 using modern contraceptive method stood at 58.4%.However, with the outbreak of COVID-19, the socio-economic trajectory of Rwanda alike many other countries in the world was negatively altered, with the Exports and Tourism sectors the most hit amid disruption in international trade and travels. Recent assessments carried out on the impact of COVID-19 in Rwanda have consistently shown that women are adversely affected by COVID-19 economically due to their high involvement in the informal sector and underrepresentation in the digital economy, unsecure employment, as well as high involvement in unpaid care work and in subsistence farming. For instance, a recent Covid-19 Gender Rapid Assessment commissioned by the Ministry of Gender and Family Promotion (MIGEPROF)in partnership with UN Women and UNFPA found that a high proportion of rural and urban women (59% and 52% respectively) reported closure of their businesses as a result of the pandemic, compared to 49% for men in both rural and urban areas. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated women and girls’ vulnerability to GBV. GBV data released by RIB have shown an increase of GBV cases from 969 cases in March 2020 to 1,243 cases in June 2020 translating to 28.3 % increase in only three months of COVID-19In addition, Rwanda still faces some challenges that require concerted efforts to address gender equality related barriers and ensure the creation of robust gender accountability systems to advance the relevant GEWE legal and policy commitments. The country has charted its way to reaching a Middle-Income Country (MIC) status and has been implementing Vision 2050 the framework that will see the Country’s accountability to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as well as the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action.To sustain the efforts to track the implementation of gender equality commitments and in line with the objectives of the State of Gender Equality in Rwanda (2019), the Gender Monitoring Office (GMO) in collaboration with UN WOMEN seeks to generate and disseminate a report that provides an up to date information on the status of gender equality including progress and gaps to provide evidence that informs policy priorities, decisions and initiatives to advance the country’s development agenda. In this context, UN WOMEN on behalf of Gender Monitoring Office seeks to hire a senior consultant to develop a second generation of the ‘’Country Gender Status Report (CGSR).’’Objectives of the assignmentThe main purpose of producing the second-generation Country Gender Status Report is to document and showcase Rwanda’s achievements on gender equality promotion, women’s empowerment across different sectors, the prevailing challenges, the promising practices and recommendations on priorities requiring much focus and action.Specific objectives of the assignment include;Scope of the assignmentThe Second generation of the Country Gender Status Report development will cover the period of 2018 to date.

We celebrate each other’s wins, learn from our setbacks, and are deeply proud of the impact we make every day. We believe that a clean, dust-free home means more than good health. It means pride and dignity in the place our customers most treasure: their homes. Being a part of our team means more than building housing products: it means building an organization and building a better future for rural families.What We DoEarthEnable is transforming the way people live, by making homes healthier for families across rural Rwanda and Uganda. 65% of Rwandans and Ugandans live in homes with dirt floors which are dusty, unsanitary, and fertile breeding grounds for parasites and germs. While replacing a dirt floor with concrete has significant health benefits (e.g. reducing diarrhea by 50% and parasitic infections by 80%), concrete is unaffordable for many who need it.EarthEnable addresses this pressing and ubiquitous problem by selling high-quality, earthen housing products that are 80% cheaper than concrete equivalents with 90% less embedded energy. Earthen construction is already prevalent in modern homes across the world, and we have innovated on distribution models that make our products ultra-affordable. EarthEnable trains and certifies local franchisees to install our products which are sealed using our proprietary drying oil that makes them waterproof, strong, and polished.About the RoleThis role is for a person who is more passionate about coaching, developing new entrepreneurs to build their own business and supporting them in the franchisees business Model.

The project seeks to increase livelihood and conservation Benefits in Sebeya (& other) catchments from restoration and improved land management.By applying the Nature-based Solutions approach, the EWMR Project has directly contributed to food security, water security, human health, economic and social development, disaster risk reduction, climate change mitigation and adaptation, and reduction of environmental degradation and biodiversity loss.At the end of the project, EKN and IUCN agreed upon the extend the project for 1 year from July 2022 to June 2023 in order to address the need for building back restored landscapes in the post-covid-19 era, strengthening local resilience in face of rising global food prices, and deepening further sustainability for the communities in the project area.Community based approachesThe EWMR project is anchored on community-based approach and in recognition of diverse community needs and priorities, it is crucial to incorporate various agricultural technologies that can help farmers to increase farm productivity and gain much more income to improve the community livelihoods.However, Crop Intensification Program (CIP) in Rwanda prioritizes high potential crops depending on the area and there are some recommended inputs (like manure from livestock, quality compost made from potential local biomass) to incorporate in soil in addition to other Climate Resilient Agriculture practices.Compost making technology presents an opportunity for multiple benefits like income generation from sale of good quality compost while contributing to the environmental restoration in terms of bio-physical soil conservation.Rationale for the assignmentFollowing recommendations based on community led Village Land Use Actions Plans (VLUAPs), scoping exercises and relevant stakeholders in agriculture sector across the 4 districts, there is need for organic manure to support agricultural production. However, the farmers lack of knowledge and skills in compost making for production of good quality organic manure resulting less than optimal productivity for crops such as potato, maize, beans, and other horticultural crops. There is an urgent need to build the capacity of farmers in production of organic manure through compost making to improve soil health and fertility and consequently enhance productivity of their farms. Therefore, the training on compost making will equip the farmers with relevant knowledge and skills that will help enable them to produce own organic manure through composting farm and animal waste.Overall objectives of the consultancyThe aim of this assignment is to impart basic knowledge and experience on how to produce good quality compost targeting farmers to ensure that households are maximizing benefits from use of organic manure thus improving productivity.Scope of the assignmentThis assignment will target farmers across 2 districts of Rubavu and Nyabihu.

This is partly related to lending conditions such as high interest rates (up to 19%) which reflects the high risks and lack of collateral, especially associated with smallholders and agricultural SMEs (given their higher reliance on variable rains and particularly low investment returns).More investments in agriculture could be made to boost agri-value chains financing and food system in Rubavu district. This can be done, in principle, by improving the incentive system of financial institutions and easing the conditions for collateral by also accepting, for example, land leases, off-taker agreements or agri-equipment as collateral (thus also redistributing risks among different value chain stakeholders) or adapting repayment schemes to farming cycles. This may go hand in hand with the provision of financial education and business management skills for the agri-chain actors.Therefore, Kilimo Trust invites applications from eligible consultant (s) or firm that will work in close consultation with GFC project team to develop a training manual/aid on financial literacy and business skills to equip vegetables value chain actors with a set of skills and knowledge that allows an individual to make informed and effective decisions with all of their financial resources.The training manual/aid should be developed in English with Kinyarwanda translation.The assignment is expected to start in November 2022 and run for a period of 30 days from the time of signing a contract.Interested and eligible consultant(s) or firm shall submit the following:All required documents must be written in English and submitted electronically in one folder torecruitment@kilimotrust.orgnot later than Wednesday16thNovember 2022at 5:00PM Rwanda Time.

Our vision is to fight for every child. We work with African visionary community leaders to implement locally relevant yet far-reaching projects that create lasting change within the justice, education, and social protection sectors. This enables us to focus on ‘hard to reach’ children, both in terms of their complex needs (e.g., street children with learning difficulties) and location (e.g., urban violent slums or remote rural areas). Together we make ideas and impact both sustainable and scalable to protect, educate and empower even more of the world’s most disadvantaged children.Our interventions in Africa are in Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, Ghana, and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).Project backgroundTubarere Mu Muryango is the implementation strategy for the National Childcare Reform which was established since 2013 with the goal of reintegrating children living in institutions and transform Rwanda’s childcare and protection system into a family-based system of care. In 2016, a national assessment showed that over 4,000 children with disabilities were still residing in the institutions. In 2018, a baseline assessment showed that some parents were in need of additional support to care for their children with disabilities.To help parents find solutions to that problem, UNICEF in partnership with Chance for Childhood have started implementing“Family strengthening and Community based support for care of children with disabilities in families Programme”since July 2021.This programme has three main objectives, such as to support those children and their families to access mainstream and disability-related services (education, healthcare, rehabilitation and social protection, child protection…). It also intends to facilitate parents/caregivers to access self-help groups and other community-based initiatives to respond to immediate special needs and build resilience for sustainable family-based care of their children with disabilities. The current programme also ensures that community-based structures have necessary knowledge/capacity to provide and support children with disabilities and their families.The programme has so far mapped 6689 children with disabilities and/or developmental delays inHuye and Bugesera Districts;has trained 6689 parents of children with disabilities and grouped them in 146 Parents Support Groups which helps them to provide psychosocial support to one another. In this programme, 7858 referrals were made to hospitals, rehabilitation centres, Education (Early childhood, primary, special school and TEVT), social and child protection. Out of the referrals made, about 30.34 % got the services whilst the remainder 69.66 % are still facing different challenges.To respond to the issue concerning large group of children with multiple impairments who could not make it to the hospitals and rehabilitation centres, the programme created 138 rehabilitation sites whereby each site has about ten (10) children with disabilities attending the rehabilitation services twice a week.Our monitoring assessments also showed that about 1310 children with disabilities need different assistive devices out of which, 220 devices were recently provided by Chance for Childhood in close collaboration with CECHE Foundation and UNICEF Rwanda.AssignmentExpected deliverablesOne 5-minute video showing achievements of the project.The final video will be shared in 2 formats:Specifications of the deliverablesVideo:Proposed storyline (can be adjusted once on field):Testimonial style video:Selected children with disabilities, parents, especially those in the village will be filmed in the community talking about how this community-based project supported them and what the situation was before. They can also talk about the training they got, Parents Support Groups and the locally affordable assistive devices in addition to the rehabilitation sites established in their communities, how community actors are supporting them now. Local authorities and community volunteers will be filmed in community and/or in the offices talking about how they have been trained and increased knowledge to support children with disabilities and their families. District officials (staff) talk about their particular experience with this project, emphasizing on district and community ownership. The National Child Development Agency (NCDA) and National Council of Persons with Disabilities (NCPD) will be filmed in their offices talking about Government’s vision in supporting children with disabilities and their families and availing necessary services in the community to prevent institutionalization of CWDs and promote the rights of all children. Chance for Childhood staff will talk about the planning and implementation of the project, key lessons learned, challenges and how they were addressed as well as how possible it is to support children with disabilities in their families and communities. UNICEF will give their appreciation of this project, and the actual intent to gradually support Government in building inclusive national child protection system and case management that support all families in need for protection and response to child protection risks.Duration of video:5 minutes.Specs:Timelines:Distribution plan:The main purpose of the video is to advocate for children with disabilities by providing experience/showcasing how it is possible to support children with disabilities and their families in their communities, and engaging Government, district authorities and decision makers to invest more in inclusive programming.

The Programme brief should be a comprehensive package reflecting lessons learned from key milestones of the project:Purpose of the programme brief RationaleIn order to achieve a successful reintegration of children with disabilities and prevent new family separation, it is necessary to think about innovative strategies to deliver results for children and their families; it is therefore very crucial to provide information to stakeholders working on child protection and disability inclusion for them to get different options especially those that are proven effective that can help to make tailored & comprehensive package of interventions aiming at supporting children with disabilities reintegrated from institutions back to families, and to improve community and family-based care by increasing accessibility/affordability of basic services as well as addressing social norms, stigma and discrimination like the current programme for prevention of new family separation. The package of interventions should be adapted to the individual community and consider the wider national context of low-resourced countries like Rwanda; this entails prioritizing interventions that build on existing resources/strengths to boost the capacity of communities for delivery of quality services to children and building of families’ resilience to adequately nurture and raise their children. The programme brief would be a good documentation to think towards sustainability of the model project, and to open for scale-up by different stakeholders.ObjectivesThe programme brief will help the government of Rwanda and its stakeholders to:Target audiencesGovernment of Rwanda and its stakeholders in child protection, social and disability inclusion at all levels have interest in the programme brief in which they will be asked to play a role.

Our vision is to fight for every child.We work with African visionary community leaders to implement locally relevant yet far-reaching projects that create lasting change within the justice, education, and social protection sectors. This enables us to focus on ‘hard to reach’ children, both in terms of their complex needs (e.g., street children with learning difficulties) and location (e.g., urban violent slums or remote rural areas). Together we make ideas and impact both sustainable and scalable to protect, educate and empower even more of the world’s most disadvantaged children. Our interventions in Africa are in Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, Ghana, and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).Background of the projectTubarere Mu Muryango is the implementation strategy for the National Childcare Reform that was implemented since 2013 with the goal of reintegrating children living in institutions and transform Rwanda’s childcare and protection system into a family-based system of care. In 2016, a national assessment showed that over 4,000 children with disabilities were still residing in the institutions. In 2018, a baseline assessment showed that some parents were in need for additional support to care for their children with disabilities. To help parents find solutions to that problem, UNICEF in partnership with Chance for Childhood have started implementing“Family strengthening and Community based support for care of children with disabilities in families Programme”since July 2021.This programme has three main objectives, such as to support those children and their families to access mainstream and disability-related services (education, healthcare, rehabilitation and social protection, child protection…). It also intends to facilitate parents/caregivers to access self-help groups and other community-based initiatives to respond to immediate special needs and build resilience for sustainable family-based care of their children with disabilities. The current programme will also ensure that community-based structures have necessary knowledge/capacity to provide and support children with disabilities and their families.The programme has so far mapped 6689 children with disabilities and/or developmental delays inHuye and Bugesera Districts;has trained 6689 parents of children with disabilities and grouped them in 146 Parents Support Groups which helps them to provide psychosocial support to one another. In this programme, 7858 referrals were made to hospitals, rehabilitation centres, Education (Early childhood, primary, special school and TEVT), social and child protection. Out of the referrals made, about 30.34 % got the services whilst the remainder 69.66 % are still facing different challenges.To respond to the issue concerning large group of children with multiple impairments who could not make it to the hospitals and rehabilitation centres, the programme created 138 rehabilitation sites whereby each site has about ten (10) children with disabilities attending the rehabilitation services twice a week.Our monitoring assessments also showed that about 1310 children with disabilities need different assistive devices out of which, 220 devices were recently provided by Chance for Childhood in close collaboration with CECHE Foundation and UNICEF Rwanda. Purpose of the Midline surveyRationaleThe midline study and subsequent report is needed to assess the extent to which targets have been achieved thus far in the project, understand the determinants enabling and/or disabling achievement of targets, the extent of ownership built among the target groups, capture key learning from the implementation experience and recommend doable actions for the remaining project period.ObjectivesThe objective of this midline survey is to see whether the project is on the right path to achieving what it is supposed to achieve, examine the possible enablers and disablers of the project achievements. This survey will also show the alternative ways to achieving sustainability and ownership by the government institutions. StakeholdersandUsersSeveral stakeholders both internal and outside of CfC have interest in the data collection and results of the Midline survey of these will be asked to play a role in the report. Table 1 below provides a preliminary stakeholder analysis, which should be deepened by the consultant during the inception and data collection phases.Accountability to targeted populations, is tied to CfC commitments to include beneficiaries as key stakeholders in their work. As such, CfC is committed to ensuring the involvement of children with disabilities, their guardians and parents and members of the support system including families of CwDs and respective communities.Table 1: Preliminary Stakeholders’ analysisTheprimaryusesofthisMidline reportwillbe:CfC will use the findings to enhance the implementation of the programme and/or re-design the programme, advocacy, and partnerships. It will also be used to decide on changes in the programme’s design and implementation of theFamily Strengthening and Community Based Support for Care of Children with Disabilities in Familiesapproach to inform the scale-up.Midline survey approachScopeThe Midline survey shall focus on the 18-month project that has been implemented in 29 sectors of two districts (Bugesera & Huye) between July2021- December 2022.Midline survey Criteria For the programme to achieve expected result, interventions must be effective to complement and enhance the current context. Midline survey will tell whether the programme will reach its objectives and sustainability. The survey will also recommend for the programme to be re-adjusted and/or re-designed. Therefore, the following questions must be answered:Data AvailabilityThe consultant will use the Midline survey data collected by the project team to analyse and write up the report. The consultant will also carry out different interviews with different stakeholders to triangulate with the data collected by the CfC team.Concerning the quality of data and information, the consultant should:MethodologyIn order to respond to the above survey questions, the consultant shall use data from interviews with families, community-based service providers, and community/ local leaders, which will contribute to an understanding of the experiences of the key stakeholders. This will provide a comprehensive understanding of the current situation of children with impairment(s) who experience disability, and their families, in the two target districts. The resultant data will be analysed thematically and/or quantitative technics.Cultural Sensitivity of the Midline surveyThe consultant should have a wide and being familiar with local traditions and particularities.Further details can be discussed during the inception phase.

              "  \"CHANCEN International is a non-profit organization that provides an ethical, fair, and responsible financing model for young people in Africa to access quality tertiary education. This financing model is called an Income Share Agreement (ISA) and was tried and tested for 20 years in Germany before being launched in East Africa in 2018. With an ISA financing model, CHANCEN International pays tuition fees during beneficiaries' tenure of their studies, and graduates pay them back according to their income at the end of their studies, thus making it possible to finance the next generation of students. CHANCEN administrative base is located in Kigali, Rwanda, and in its first two years of financing operations, more than 1300 young people accessed funds for their tertiary education. CHANCEN believes that young Africans are ready to take on the problems that have hold their continent back if they are fairly and responsibly empowered. Education is one of the vehicles for harnessing that potential, and we work to create equal access to high-quality tertiary education for traditionally excluded populations. Our unique and innovative model of responsible and sustainable financing has the power to unleash intergenerational economic mobility for marginalized youth as they gain the skills required to participate in building strong economies and peaceful nations.CHANCEN International's next phase of growth comes with the launch of the Zamuka-Future of Work Fund, a non-deposit taking central bank regulated institution, which provides a blended investment opportunity for investors who want to ensure that the next generation of youth in Africa acquire employable skills and move into gainful employment. Our Income Share Agreement model has ensured students were able to continue their education to employment journey in the midst of the COVID-19 crisis and the demand from both students and partner institutions have seen a sharp increase in recent months due to reduction in household income and the ability for excluded youth to pay for education.Chancen International Rwanda is looking for a qualified and competent staff to fill the position of IT and MIS Director.

              "  'Terms of Reference for ConsultantConsultancy opportunity to conduct a Formative Research on the factors contributing to impairment in children and adolescents in RwandaBackgroundDisability is a major public health concern worldwide and the situation for children with disabilities is even more serious. The CRPD states that “persons with disabilities include those who have long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments which in interaction with various barriers may hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others”. Some children will be born with a disabling health condition or impairment, while others may experience disability as a result of illness, injury or poor nutrition. Children with disabilities include those with health conditions such as cerebral palsy, spina bifida, muscular dystrophy, traumatic spinal cord injury, Down syndrome, and children with hearing, visual, physical, communication and intellectual impairments. A number of children have a single impairment while others may experience multiple impairments. For example, a child with cerebral palsy may have mobility, communication and intellectual impairments. The complex interaction between a health condition or impairment and environmental and personal factors means that each child’s experience of disability is different.It is estimated that, overall, between 500 and 650 million people worldwide live with a significant impairment. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), around 10 per cent of the world’s children and young people, have a sensory, intellectual or mental health impairment. Around 80 per cent of them live in developing countries. Statistics such as these demonstrate that to be born with or acquire an impairment is far from being unusual or abnormal. Specialists, however, agree on a working approximation giving a minimum benchmark of 2.5 per cent of children aged 0-14 with self-evident moderate to severe levels of sensory, physical and intellectual impairments. An additional 8 per cent can be expected to have learning or behavioral difficulties, or both.The Fourth Rwanda Population and Housing Census (2012 RPHC) reports revealed approximately 20% (87,900) of the population of persons with disabilities are children between the ages of five and eighteen.Many of disabling conditions in children are preventable. In Africa, one of the foremost causes of disability are infectious and communicable disease; the incidence of these diseases have been greatly reduced or eliminated in higher income countries. Other causes include war, trauma, accidents, and congenital and Non communicable diseases.Early identification, referral and management ofimpairments in childrenhas been emphasized by the National policy of persons with disabilities and its four years’ strategic plan (2021-2024) especially the strategic objective related to the strengthening of early identification, diagnostic assessment, and intervention, prioritizing children with disabilities.In response to this, different interventions are being carried out within the health sector. However, lack of evidence on disability determinants and factors contributing to the impairment in children constitute a hindrance to the good performance of the above mentioned interventions.In partnership with RBC, NCPD and NCDA under the financial and technical support of the UNICEF, UPHLS is planning to conduct a formative Research on the factors contributing to impairment in children and adolescents in Rwanda. The research shall include the improvement plan.It is therefore worthy to conduct the formative research onthe factors contributing to impairment in children and adolescents in Rwandain order tohave the strategies to address identified factors. Once conducted, the research findings will not only inform policy makers’ planning but also provide guidance on management and/or referral of different types of major impairments in children.To this regards, UPHLS in partnership with RBC under financial and technical support of UNICEF is recruiting a national consultant who will conduct the Formative Research on the factors contributing to impairment in children and adolescents in Rwanda.Objectives of the consultancyUnder the direct supervision of UPHLS and guidance from Disability and inclusive health TWG (MoH/RBC, NCPD, NCDA and UNCEF), the consultant will conduct the formative research to identify the factors contributing to impairment in children and adolescents in Rwanda.The specific objectives of the consultancy are:Expected ResultsRBC and its partners including UNICEF, NCDA, NCPD and UPHLS will use the results of the formative research to develop strategies to address the identified gaps and to design interventions for the prevention and management of impairment in children in Rwanda.MethodologyThe selected consultant will be requested to present to Disability and Inclusive health TWG members, the inception report detailing the practical work plan, proposed research methodology and data collection tools which should include: process and sampling criteria. The TWG will provide in written the feedbacks to the consultant which should be observed before the approval of the TWG.The consultant will submit and follow up with RNEC the research protocol for presentation, approval and clearance.Scope of workIn close consultation with the MoH/RBC, the National Council of Persons with Disabilities (NCPD), the National Childhood Development Agency (NCDA) and key stakeholders and UPHLS, develop a detailed work plan that will outline the specific activities/tasks, timelines and associated costs. Specifically, the consultant will undertake the following:Geographical locationThe geographical location must be representative of the four Provinces and the City of Kigali. The following 10 districts have been selected based on geographical location and data shown by the Fourth Population and Housing Census, Rwanda, 2012: Nyagatare, Gatsibo and Bugesera in Eastern Province, Huye, Gisagara and Kamonyi in Southern Province, Gasanbo in the City of Kigali, Gicumbi in Northern Province and Karongi, Rubavu in Western Province.Study populationThe research will target children with disabilities and their parents. Also different relevant people/institutions will be interviewed: health care providers from health facilities, key public institutions (RBC, NCPD, NCDA, etc.), organizations of persons with disabilities (OPDs) and other key stakeholders working in disability area.Main deliverablesWork relationships, supervision and stakeholder participationUPHLS, in close consultation with MoH/ RBC NCPD, NCDA and UNICEF will be responsible for supervising the formative research.

              "  'TECHNICAL ADVISOR - LODATerms of ReferenceBackgroundProject Objective is to improve livelihoods for 17,750 households/76,000 people and the capacity of national, and local government including villages, to enhance citizen engagement in 249 villages in Rwanda. This will be achieved through a set of activities combining sustainable livelihood grants for poor, rural villages and capacity building for district, sector, cell and village officials on inclusive, participatory planning. The project will be implemented in four districts, seven sectors and 249 villages, which constitutes 10-12 percent of the villages in the project districts. The total population in the target villages, according to official data, is 152,645. This entire number is expected to benefit from improved village planning and engagement with local government, including enhanced understanding of and access to government social protection programs. On average, approximately 70 households in each target village will attend meetings and benefit from a range of activities, including capacity-building for planning and savings groups. This equates to 17,750 HH, for a total of approximately 76,000 direct beneficiaries.The project has two sets of beneficiaries. The first group is the rural poor at the village level in the targeted areas, who will benefit from: (a) technical support to engage in participatory village planning and prepare a Village Development Plan (VDP); and (b) a small grant to implement priority livelihood sub-projects identified in the VDP. Experience also suggests that the project approach enhances participation in Village Savings and Loan Associations (VSLAs). By strengthening communication between government and village members, it also generates welfare benefits through increased uptake of government social protection programmes by the rural poor.The second group of beneficiaries will be government officials and institutions at the national and sub-national levels who will benefit from technical support on: (a) citizen engagement and participatory planning and; (b) how to translate this practical experience into a national framework on participatory village planning. At the village level, the project will directly benefit approximately 85,000 people (50 percent gender split) across 249 villages. The direct beneficiaries are the members of the estimated 80 households in each village who will attend regular weekly meetings to be facilitated by the project. They are also expected to benefit from increased capacity for planning, improved uptake of government social protection programs and from the micro-grant under component two. There will be 152,645 indirect beneficiaries, which is the total population in the target villages, who are expected to benefit from improved village planning and engagement with local government.Villages will benefit in two ways: (a) participation in village planning and attendance at weekly meetings, which will increase their capacity to engage with local government; and (b) livelihood improvements from increased uptake of government social protection programs, the Micro-grant project and savings groups. Those in the lowest income brackets (Ubudehe 3 and 4 categories) and families will be included through mobilization strategies, including having zone representatives who encourage all households in their village zone to attend meetings, having someone alert households to the village meeting beforehand, and asking villagers to encourage their immediate neighbors to come and walk with them to the meeting. Participation by all village members is encouraged by emphasizing that everyone’s voice is important, appreciating those who provide input and a common understanding that contributions from all households are critical to successful collective action.The project will benefit national and sub-national government officials to connect the demand and supply-sides. Local Government officials are responsible for citizen engagement but do not always have enough skills to lead participatory processes. The project will support the district, sector, and cell-level officials to prepare participatory village plans. The project will also benefit national-level officials in the ministries in charge of finance and local government by providing technical assistance to prepare a national framework for participatory village planning.The project is currently being implemented in 7 sectors in Gakenke, Gicumbi, Burera, and Huye districts in two of Rwanda’s four provinces (Northern and Southern province). Within these provinces, a list of target districts was prepared, based on official household profiling and livelihood data provided by LODA and MINALOC, and considering the socio-economic impacts of COVID-19. Sectors were selected based on an assessment of poverty levels, the numbers of people in Ubudehe categories 1 and 2 and malnutrition rates, using data submitted by the District. After shortlisting 4-5 sectors per district, the final decision on project sites was made based on readiness to implement the project (e.g., full complement of SEDOs in place) and limited presence of other NGO or development partner programs. This resulted in the final list of four districts and seven sectors, which has been approved by the respective District.Table of target districts, sector, cells and villagesDistrictSectorCellVillagesPopulationBureraRwerere42820,759BureraKinyababa43223,242GakenkeBusengo73823,044GicumbiMutete53826,457GicumbiCyumba62817,488HuyeGishamvu42515,346HuyeKigoma86026,309Total738249152,645Within the target sectors, all villages will be covered (a ‘sector saturation’ model), in order to capitalize on the investments in capacity development of local government officials. All households/people in each village are eligible to participate in meetings and decisions, run for local leadership, and benefit from activities in the VDPs, including microgrant-funded through sub-projects. The project will pay particular attention to improving the voice and representation of women and people in low-income categories as well as youth and persons with disabilities. The participation of people in these groups will be tracked throughout the project.Objectives and Scope of WorkJob purposeBased in Kigali, Rwanda, the Adviser on Village Level Planning for socio economic transformation will provide technical assistance to LODA.

              "  'Short Term Consultancy to Develop Tailored Loan Products for the Health Sector in RwandaCompany InformationPalladium is a global leader in the design, development, and delivery of Positive Impact - the intentional creation of enduring social and economic value. We work with foundations, investors, governments, corporations, communities, and civil society to formulate strategies and implement solutions that generate lasting social, environmental, and financial benefits.For the past 50 years, we have been making Positive Impact possible. With a team of more than 2,500 employees operating in 90 plus countries and a global network of more than 35,000 technical experts, Palladium has improved - and is committed to continuing to improve - economies, societies and most importantly, people\\'s lives.2.Project SummaryPalladium is implementing the Rwanda Integrated Health Systems Activity (RIHSA), a three-year USAID-funded task order (720-696-20-F-00001) designed to support the Ministry of Health in strengthening Rwanda’s health system to provide quality health care for Rwandans while building the capacity of the Government of Rwanda (GOR) to move away from a donor-financed health system towards a self-reliant system. The project is aimed at achieving two major objectives:Through a focus on financing and quality, USAID-RIHSA provides technical assistance to the GOR on various strategies, tools and approaches that will allow Rwanda to sustainably fund its healthcare system and provide quality care at all levels. The Activity is implemented by a consortium led by Palladium International LLC (Palladium) in partnership with RTI International, the Council for Health Service Accreditation of Southern Africa (COHSASA), Zenysis Technologies, and the Rwanda Agency for Accreditation and Quality of Healthcare (RAAQH).3.ContextThe Government of Rwanda has prioritized the private sector as a critical partner in its efforts to achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC). Some of the priority areas of the GOR for private health investment include provision of specialized diagnostic and treatment services (e.g. medical imaging & diagnostic laboratories), manufacturing of medical supplies and equipment (e.g. medical implants, medicine and medical equipment), among others. To achieve this, financing is needed to either construct health facilities, acquire equipment, expand existing facilities or meet running costs. In Rwanda, the health products portfolio in financial institutions is still relatively small has potential for growth. A recent survey on financing opportunities for the private health sector in Rwanda highlighted the limited existence of health-related loan products in the market, with some of the few products available requiring high collateral requirements and offering unfavorable interest rates. While financial institutions view the sector as risky with high potential for credit loss, they also face challenges related to understanding the needs and dynamics of the health sector and thus find it challenging to tailor loan products for this sector. Consequently, health sector entrepreneurs continuously grapple with limited access to credit facilities amidst the financial constraints posed by delayed reimbursements from insurance providers. In addition, the changing epidemiological profile and healthcare needs of the population calls for the adoption of new and effective technologies, and the employment of highly skilled personnel, which come at a very high cost hence the need for comprehensive financial solutions to meet Healthcare Sector funding requirements. In light of the above, USAID RIHSA is commissioning a consultancy to formulate better strategies towards unlocking the needed finance (with favorable terms) for the private health sector.4.Objective & scope of workThe objective of this assignment is to support selected Financial Institutions in Rwanda to develop at least two loan products tailored to the health sector, and/or modify existing products to meet the needs and dynamics of the health sector (includingHospitals, Clinics, Health Posts, Medical Laboratories and Diagnostic Centers and Pharmacies among others).5.Expected DeliverablesThe consultant is expected to develop at least two (2) loan products tailored to the health sector financing needs. The consultant shall:1.Engage Financial Institutions (Banks and MFIs)to shortlist those that are interested in direct product development support.2. From the shortlisted institutions, review their existing health sector loan products including features of the product(s), disbursement history/trends and client feedback on the product (s),3. Work closely with product development teams from the selected financial institutions to scope, identify, and design at least 2 new loan products and/or improve existing ones targeting health sector clients.6.Level of EffortThe level of effort for this consultancy is estimated to be not more that 18 working days and to be implemented with 3 Months from the date of signing a contract. The timeline is as follows:Activity/MilestoneTimelinesInception report1 week from date of signing contractScoping and identification of interested financial institutions2nd week from date of contractStakeholder consultations & Review of existing loan products3rd week from date of contractDraft Loan Products7th week from date of contractValidation of the products with the managers of the selected financial institutions10th week from date of contractSubmission of at least 2 newfinal loan productsand a brief summarizing their potential as viable products12th week from date of contract7.Contract TypeThis consultancy will be a fixed price deliverable-based contract.

Its main goal is to achieve a society in which laws and rights are respected by everyone, and its mission is to promote respect of human rights and integral socioeconomic progress of Rwandan population by emphasizing gender promotion, civic participation, access to justice and environmental protection and rural development.BackgroundIn the last two years, the world faced a severe and acute public health emergency due to the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic. The pandemic and its response, in the form of protracted nationwide lockdowns, have had several short-term as well as long-term impacts on human health, society, the economy, and the environment. Particularly, the Pandemic has deeply affected businesses and jobs. Globally and in Rwanda as well, companies (Micro, small, and medium enterprises) were under strain due to unfavorable working conditions imposed by the Pandemic. The economic conditions slowdown forced the families to initiate serious decisions on usual spending. This with many other decisions explains several impacts associated with Covid-19. School dropout and a sharp increase in GBV, conflicts, and domestic violence were among the most severe social conditions currently society is facing. Addressing social and economic problems induced and accelerated by Covid-19, the Government of Rwanda through its various ministries and in collaboration with international organizations, non-government organizations, and other agencies in consultation with various economic stakeholders and development partners in formulating and implementing plans to expand its social protection programs and to increase economic support.Under the fund from Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC), TUBIBE AMAHORO is implementing the project titled “Fostering citizens’ self-reliance to mitigate COVID-19 effects in Karongi and Rutsiro districts”. The diverse impacts of COVID-19 in Rwanda as well as in project target districts were severe distinctively. In this regard, TUBIBE AMAHORO is willing to hire a consultancy firm that will conduct a baseline survey aimed to identify social-economic impacts imposed by COVID-19. The baseline survey is expected to provide the basic information guiding the organization to record and consider provided recommendations for future decisions regarding the implementation of the project in order to mitigate COVID-19 impacts on social and economic conditions. The primary objective of the present survey is to evaluate the impacts of COVID-19 on social-economic statuses of citizens from the target districts. Specifically, the effects of COVID-19 on GBV increase and household and cooperative businesses should be cleared and propose the possible mitigation measures. In addition, based on the project outcomes, the consultant will need to identify the vulnerable groups of businesses and people mostly affected by GBV and business shutdown during the pandemic to further orient organizational resources in terms of mitigations and adaptations to COVID-19 imposed conditions.The qualified and experienced consultants and consulting firms previously worked in social-economic impacts assessment are therefore allowed to compete basing on the following directive pre-process and further process detailed within the Terms of Reference.Submission of ProposalsYou are requested to adhere to the deadline, proposals submitted after the deadline will be automatically rejected and returned unopened to the bidder.Done at Karongi, October 03rd, 2022Pierre Célestin KABANOExecutive Secretary of TUBIBE AMAHORO'],\n",

We need you to help us achieve it.In Rwanda alone, we have planted over 50M trees in the last 4 years, and our tree program distributes over 20 million trees, to over 1 million farmers annually. We do this through the hybrid production model (producing tree seedlings from 6 central nurseries and over 1,000 decentralized nurseries) and a distribution model that uses our partnership with the Rwandan government's extension network, Twigire Muhinzi.Yet despite these major successes we have a lot more to do to reach our potential: a) scale the program beyond 20 million trees per year b) increase impact per farmer by improving the tree products we offer, performance (e.g. survival), diversification, intensification, and market access c) increase program sustainability by finding ways to generate an income (e.g. accessing financing opportunities, such as the carbon credit market, or monetizing portions of our work), or improve efficiencyResponsibilitiesThis is an exciting opportunity to lead a growing department that inspires some of the largest impacts in the organization. The department lead will:1) Coach leaders:Oversee our yearly tree campaign. You will primarily support and empower leaders to run our tree campaign independently and come up with their own strategy2) Prioritize collaboratively building longer-term strategies:so that a) the decisions we make today, support our strategic priorities tomorrow b) team leads can develop shorter-term strategies c) the tree program supports wider organizational goals (e.g. commercialization)3) Strategic innovations:build and oversee a culture where major and minor innovations are identified, tested and scaled, and ensure they are contributing to wider organizational priorities.
